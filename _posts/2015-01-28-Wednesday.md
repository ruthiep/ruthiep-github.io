puts "Day three"

puts "Today was much better.  Andrew taught the class for the first time, and we went over the checksplitter and dinner club problem.  Most of the class didn't get it working on the first try either.  \n It was really helpful to have some review a chance to catch up.  He taught at UNO, and seems to be really good and communicating the information.  Not feeling so freaked out now.\nI got the rest of the program to work by myself...and in a reasonable, short amount of time!"
